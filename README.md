# Schedule I Decomp

## What
Basically an unmodified dump of the code inside ``Assembly-CSharp.dll`` of the game's ``alternate`` branch.  

For game research/modding purposes. Also to provide a nice diff of the game's code every game update.  

Contains a lot of random libraries, most of the game-specific code is in the root and in the ``ScheduleOne`` folder.  

For some supplemental content about the technical details of this game, you can check out [BigWilly](https://www.youtube.com/@itsbigwilly_/videos) on YouTube (not affiliated).  

Repository is up to date for game version v0.3.5

## Contact
If [Tyler](https://steamcommunity.com/id/tyler_tvgs) or any other representative of [TVGS](https://www.scheduleonegame.com/presskit/index.html) wants this repository to be taken down, they can message me on my Discord and I will gladly take it down as soon as possible:
``thecatinyourceiling``

I have took the existence of the ``alternate`` branch as accepting the fact of random people being able to reverse the game's code in seconds and do whatever they want with it. As such, I do not believe he would be against me making this repository. If that is not the case and he's somehow not aware that Mono games are trivial to decompile I have left all doors wide open for contact.
