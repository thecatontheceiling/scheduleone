# Schedule I Decomp

## What
Basically an unmodified dump of the code inside ``Assembly-CSharp.dll`` of the game's ``alternate`` branch.  

For game research/modding purposes. Also to provide a nice diff of the game's code every game update.  

Contains a lot of random libraries, most of the game-specific code is in the root and in the ``ScheduleOne`` folder.  

For some supplemental content about the technical details of this game, you can check out [BigWilly](https://www.youtube.com/@itsbigwilly_/videos) on YouTube (not affiliated).  

Repository is up to date for game version v0.3.5
